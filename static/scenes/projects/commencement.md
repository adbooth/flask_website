# Streamlining Commencement
##### A UB Computer Engineering Senior Capstone Project
---
### The Problems:
- Students are frequently flustered and confused when being shepherded through the commencement queues
- Names at the ceremony are often pronounced incorrectly
- The order in which the students walk must be recorded

### The Solution:
A device which uses a QR code to identify a candidate and subsequently relay his or her pre-recorded name over the audio system.

Using a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/), a [touchscreen](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/), a [Raspberry Pi camera module](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/), and [some well-designed software](https://github.com/adbooth/Commencement-Scanner), we were able to put together a device which can quickly scan a student's QR code, detect their presence in the database, and output their name recording over the audio system in less than a second.

This system was [used live at our commencement ceremony](https://youtu.be/C3w5u50MtWU?list=PLz7b7fCvZsynF3NaRitjIxJNzODz9Sk7K&t=1365) for the computer engineering department. The device was [activated inline](https://youtu.be/C3w5u50MtWU?list=PLz7b7fCvZsynF3NaRitjIxJNzODz9Sk7K&t=1182) between the civil engineering and computer science candidates without a noticeable transition and, of course, without a bug.
